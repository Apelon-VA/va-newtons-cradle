/**
 * CAS on objects utilizes the object pointer (identity) to determine 
 * if the current value == the expected value.
 * 
 * The original object is a byte array, where the 1st 64 bits is a long 
 * value that provides an object version identifier. 
 * 
 * To write an updated object, perform a get, then compare the 1st 64 bits with
 * the first 64 bits of the object to be written. If they are the same, then there 
 * have been no writes between when the new object was read, and write of the 
 * new object can proceed without a merge. 
 * 
 * If they are not the same, then the objects must be merged, and then write attempted again.
 * 
 * Write sequences can be allocated in parallel based on a modulus of the object key,
 * as a key to the sequence allocator.
 * 
 * Each version has a stamp, and these stamps uniquely identify the versions, and 
 * merger can be performed by creating a set union of the versions as identified by
 * their stamps.
 * 
 * Fields: 
 *  Write sequence
 *  Native ID
 *  Container Sequence
 *  stamp
 *  length
 *  data...
 *  stamp
 *  length
 *  data...
 *  stamp // if stamp < 0; then end of record.
